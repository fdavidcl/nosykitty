Now, visit `http://your_username.github.io/nosykitty` and follow the rest of steps **from your site**:

- [Add "staticmanapp" as a collaborator to your repository](https://github.com/{{ site.github.repository_nwo }}/settings/collaboration)
- [Visit this link to enable staticman](https://api.staticman.net/v2/connect/{{ site.github.repository_nwo }})
- You can now delete [the files under `_posts`](https://github.com/{{ site.github.repository_nwo }}/tree/gh-pages/_posts)
- When you receive a question, it will show up as a [pull request on your repository](https://github.com/{{ site.github.repository_nwo }}/pulls). You can **edit the new file** and add your answer, then **merge** the pull request.
