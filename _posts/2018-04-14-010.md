:smiley_cat: **nosykitty** is an open-source CuriousCat clone in the form of a static [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site. Instead of hosting lots of users in a single platform, nosykitty is **managed by the user**. 

This website is running on nosykitty, so you can see how it looks. You send questions with the form above, but they will be answered in [David's ask page](http://david.quotient.space/ask) instead of here.
