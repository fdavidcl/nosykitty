:smiley_cat: **nosykitty** is an open-source CuriousCat clone in the form of a static [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site. Instead of hosting lots of users in a single server, nosykitty is **managed by the user**. 

This website is running on nosykitty, so you can see how it looks. You can test sending a question with the form above, but it will not be shown in this feed since this is the main project site.
